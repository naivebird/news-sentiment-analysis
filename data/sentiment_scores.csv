But a park board commissioner says the plan is meant to cater pool facilities to a broader demographic.But now, a proposed redesign of the aquatic centre would see its 50-metre, Olympic-sized pool cut in half — a move that has ignited opposition and anongoing petitionfrom competitive swimmers like Stack-Hunter and her local swim club.The new proposalThe Vancouver Park Board is set to vote on the staff-recommendedproposalon Monday. It would see the existing pool — built in 1974 and described as being at ""the end of its functional lifespan"" — replaced with a new facility featuring a 25-metre lap pool, dive platforms, a leisure pool and other recreational amenities.When it first opened, the centre was a premier sporting venue in the densely populated West End, drawing swimmers, synchronized swimming teams, water polo players and divers for training and competitions. It continues to be in high demand for recreation programs and swimming lessons.An artistic rendering shows what the new smaller pool could look like.(Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation)However, a city staff report says the aging pool is no longer viable because it fails to meet modern seismic standards.The centre made headlines in March 2022 after a large piece of the facade of the building fell off overnight.Concerns over losing training spaceJeannie Lo, president of the Canadian Dolphin Swim Club, says the potential loss of space is a major concern.""It would really displace a lot of our programs, and we're not sure where we would go,"" she said.

"Under new coach, Vancouver Whitecaps prepare for winding MLS season","The last two months have been a whirlwind of airports and soccer pitches for Jesper Sorensen.Hired as the new head coach of the Vancouver Whitecaps in mid-January, he's spent the last five-and-a-half weeks preparing his team for the Major League Soccer season while simultaneously crisscrossing the globe for training camps in Vancouver and Spain and a CONCACAF Champions Cup game in Costa Rica.Now, the MLS campaign is set to begin Sunday when the 'Caps visit their regional rivals, the Portland Timbers.The ample travel has given the team lots of time together, during which Sorensen has witnessed a cohesive group with ""extremely good spirit.""""In sports, you will always meet adversity and the bad times,"" said the Danish bench boss. ""And that's when you really have to be well connected and trust each other. That's what we always want to do, building belief and trust in between each other. Because we know it's not just a straight road to the stars, it's always winding. And we have to be prepared for that.""The Whitecaps' off-season brought several unexpected bumps.The club fired head coach Vanni Sartini in mid-November after Vancouver finished the MLS season with a 13-13-8 record and was ousted from the playoffs by Los Angeles FC in a three-game first-round series.Then, in December, Vancouver's ownership group announced the club was up for sale.

""I've been on teams before where it's like 20 new guys and it takes a long time to get up and running. So the fact that the majority of us are all familiar with each other, we've got that strong spine of the team. It's good to have that.

We want to play as a team. We want to get crosses in the box when we get numbers high, and it's a very attacking-minded style of play,"" he said. ""So as a forward, obviously, that's what you want to hear. So I think it's going to be an exciting season.""Defender Ranko Veselinovic is adjusting to a new role that requires a bit more patience with the ball.""We don't need to rush. But also, we're going to take a little bit more risk in the back line,"" he said. ""So we need to be ready for that, not allow opponents to get their momentum if they win a few balls there.

"As Vancouver mulls extended drinking hours, hospitality industry says B.C. liquor laws still too strict","For some Vancouver nightclubs, opening for an extra hour is what can make them profitable in a given week, says Jeff Guignard.Guignard, executive director of B.C.'s Alliance of Beverage Licensees, says it's about time that Vancouver changes its operating and service hours, which have largely remained the same since 2004.""About half of the hospitality businesses in the province are still struggling to make ends meet. So this will go a long way to supporting them,"" he said.Until March 9, the City of Vancouver is asking the public what it thinks about extending liquor service hours in the downtown core and beyond. The city has received nearly 3,000 survey responses so far, according to chief licence inspector Sarah Hicks.The changes would allow all downtown bars, pubs and nightclubs to apply to stay open until 3 a.m. every night of the week. All Vancouver restaurants that are licensed to serve alcohol, not just those downtown, could also apply to serve alcohol until 2 a.m. every night of the week.But while the hospitality industry in the city, often referred to as ""no fun city,"" welcomes the move, it says it's no panacea as other B.C. liquor laws are still too strict, preventing Vancouver from having a more vibrant nightlife.Unlike some other provinces, B.C. has two types of licences that allow establishments to serve liquor.(iStock)'Real-life Footloose'Bert Hick, president of Riding Tide Consultants, which helps businesses across the country get liquor licences, says liquor laws are more stringent in B.C. than in other provinces.""In British Columbia, having a liquor licence has always been viewed as being a privilege,"" said Hick, who also previously served as general manager of the B.C. Liquor Control and Licensing Branch (now the B.C. Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch).""In other provinces like Ontario and Alberta, it's considered a right, like a driver's licence. You go through a basic process, and you get a licence.""Canada's weird liquor lawsTo get a sense of how B.C. compares to other provinces, bottle service — where nightclub customers can order an entire bottle of spirits to their table — just became legal in the provincelast month, when it's been allowed in Ontario for more than 20 years.Sunset Lounge Bar and Grill in Prince Rupert, B.C., seen in this undated photo, was recently handed a hefty fine and liquor licence suspension after it served customers after hours and held a karaoke night against regulations.(Sunset Lounge/Facebook)Unlike some other provinces, B.C. has two types of licences that allow establishments to serve liquor. A liquor primary licence means a business's primary focus is offering alcohol.These licences take an average of five-and-a-half months to process and require local government input, which can delay the process longer, according to the Public Safety Ministry. Applications that require public input can increase processing times by more than 30 days, the ministry said.B.C. liquor laws need to keep up with the times, says brewery owner after closure of kids' play areaPints on patios, but not in parks — why drinking alcohol in public spaces is still such a big dealIt's why, Hick says, many businesses opt instead for the speedier food primary licence — they can still serve alcohol but food must be their primary focus.They have to deck out their businesses with tables and chairs and have to get permission before they can hold dine-and-dance or karaoke events. Currently, in B.C., there are more than 6,000 active food primary licences and about 1,800 liquor primary licences, according to the province.Many businesses have been penalized for operating outside their licence class. Last year, a Vancouver Greek restaurant was fined $10,000, partly because it didn't have the proper licence to allow its customers to dance.This month, a Prince Rupert, B.C., bar that holds a food primary licence was slapped with a $10,000 fine and a 22-day licence suspension after it served customers after hours and held a karaoke night against regulations.""What are we living?

End to public access at some Vancouver school fields has neighbourhood group frustrated,"An East Vancouver neighbourhood group is voicing its frustration over the Vancouver School Board's (VSB) decision to close a number of school fields to the public, saying it's cutting off the community's access to green space.Over the past couple of years, the school board has blocked the public from using the fields at Templeton, Lord Nelson and Charles Tupper on Vancouver's East Side, and at Lord Byng, Lord Roberts, Lord Tennyson and Bayview on the city's West Side.The school board says the move is necessary to protect students from the holes dogs were digging in the fields, but members of the Greenspace Action Committee say other less restrictive solutions exist.Jacob Larmour, a representative of the committee, said many people rely on the city's network of public green spaces, parks and school fields.Jacob Larmour has banded together with other community members to advocate for access to the fields that the Vancouver School Board has closed to the public.

As CBC’s Meera Bains reports, they say these green spaces are needed by residents and children in the densely populated neighbourhood when schools aren’t operating.The Greenspace Action Committee created a survey to try and understand the impact of the field closures. They put up posters around the East Side schools, and have so far received responses from 190 people.Among other findings, Popkin said the survey showed many people had used the fields daily or weekly, and that the closures have made it harder for them to stay active.Digging holesIn a statement, the Vancouver School Board said the fields are closed because dogs had been damaging them by digging holes, making it dangerous for students. The school board said it recognizes many of its amenities are important for community members, but that it prioritizes student access.While community members are welcome to use school spaces, the district said if people violate that ""privilege,"" it ""reserves the right to cancel the use of any school facility or grounds.""The field west of Templeton Secondary School is pictured, locked to the public in Vancouver, on Jan. 24, 2025.(Ben Nelms/CBC)Not allowed to talkLarmour and Popkin said they applied to speak about the issue at a Vancouver School Board meeting.""We were refused the opportunity to speak and to make our case.

Vancouver Public Library defends policy that prevents staff from wearing Palestinian symbols,"The head of the Vancouver Public Library is defending a policy that dictates what symbols its roughly 800 staff can wear while at work, amid concerns from employees that the rules unfairly single out symbols that show support for Palestinians.VPL's interim chief librarian and CEO Dawn Ibey said Monday in an interview with CBC News that the VPL's policy applies to all political symbols.""We're not singling out any particular symbol, but the goal of the policy is to ensure that all employees have a safe and respectful workplace that's free from bullying, harassment and discrimination,"" she said.The concerns stem from a meeting that took place last summer during which employees were asking then-VPL CEO and chief librarian Christina de Castell for clarification about which symbols are acceptable.What does the inverted red triangle used by some pro-Palestinian demonstrators symbolize?'Chilling effect': People expressing pro-Palestinian views censured, suspended from work and schoolOne employee said they heard that staff were asked not to wear watermelon pins, which have become a global symbol used to show solidarity with Palestinians, and asked if the policy prohibits all national symbols.In response, de Castell said pins that have political symbols and represent personal beliefs ""are not appropriate to wear in the workplace"" but said poppies and peace signs are permitted as ""it's quite rare to hear someone saying they're political or polarizing.""A transcript of the meeting has been made public in a 196-page documentpackagereleased by the city through an access to information request. The package also shows that roughly two weeks before the meeting, a member of the public complained to the VPL that staff were wearing watermelons, which one library branch head called ""distressing.""WATCH | Why watermelons have become a Palestinian symbol:How the watermelon became a symbol of the Palestinian cause1 year agoDuration2:39How the watermelon emoji became a prominent symbol on social media to signal solidarity with the Palestinian people, according to two Middle East experts.VPL board approves symbolsIbey explained that staff are not allowed to wear any political symbols unless the board has taken a position on it and that it relates to library services. It's why staff are allowed to wear orange shirts, and Every Child Matters buttons in support of residential school survivors, Ibey said.The board also advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. It has declined requests to advocate for other topics, including the federal government's $10-a-day child-care plan.VPL's advocacy and endorsement policy was last updated in 2022, but since then, there has been an ""increase in very polarizing issues and public positions,"" de Castell wrote to staff this past summer.""Displaying personal political opinions at work through symbols is not appropriate when the result is that parts of our community feel unwelcome in our spaces, and we have received public feedback that this is the consequence of wearing watermelon pins at VPL,"" she said.""This choice and related behaviours are hurting the public and your colleagues and are creating a negative working environment.""Cautious optimism in Vancouver's Palestinian, Israeli communities over ceasefire dealNorthern Health defends handling of complaint over director's pro-Palestinian statementsVPL's policies state that religious symbols are allowed, which include the Star of David, Ibey said.During the summer meeting, employees pointed out discrepancies in the library's policy. For example, one library branch hosted an exhibit in 2022 which featured images of Ukraine defending itself against Russia. The library also permits displays of the Canadian flag and for staff to wear flags of other countries if they're from there to let the public know that they speak the language of that country.'Progressive except for Palestine'One employee questioned why library staff are encouraged to display the rainbow Pride flag during Pride Week.Ibey said the library is continuing to have conversations about what symbols are acceptable.""These are complex issues, and we continue to work through them with our staff,"" Ibey said.""We have a diversity of opinions on both sides of any issue or on however many sides there are, as well as members of the public.

Neither the VSB, nor then-tenant Royal Oak, could agree on a lease amount, so the matter went to an arbitration panel in 1999.That panel set a lease for the site, and ruled that the annual rent should be based on the land's immediate redevelopment value, and current use as a retail space.WATCH | Kingsgate Mall celebrates 50th anniversary:Kingsgate Mall celebrates 50 years in Mount Pleasant11 months agoDuration4:022024 marks 50 years since Kingsgate Mall opened in Vancouver's Mount Pleasant neighbourhood.

In 2015, they applied to renew the Kingsgate lease again, but once again the board and developer couldn't agree on terms.The dispute led to the 2022 arbitration hearing, in which a panel rejected the 1999 hearing's interpretation and said the property's worth should be assessed off the value it could have if it took advantage of available upzoning.The ruling increased the worth of the land to $116.5 million, and set the rent to $9.6 million per year.Kingsgate Mall has been an East Vancouver fixture for over 50 years.(Ben Nelms/CBC)Beedie argued the 2022 decision misinterpreted the 1999 ruling over what constituted ""immediate"" redevelopment value.In her December decision, B.C.

It was just the same in a different setting.""Film on legacy of residential schools in Canada nominated for best documentary at 2025 OscarsBefore that, he'd been an extra in a French movie about lucha libre wrestling, made in Mexico, when Diehz was 18.His dreams of becoming a star were quickly dashed when he was told to curse at the top of his lungs in a scene, something he was taken aback by. His shock wasn't quite the reaction the filmmakers were looking for.""They chose someone else,"" Diehz said.  ""I said no, screen acting is not for me.""Fast forward about 30 years, and Diehz decided to try it again after he and his wife became empty nesters. He took some online acting courses during the pandemic, got an agent and started doing auditions.ConclaveHis transition from design to film all happened quite quickly, Diehz said, when he responded to an open casting call for the role of Benitez in 2022.Originally, he said, the casting director was looking for a Filipino actor for the role because in the book that inspired the film — Robert Harris's 2016 novel — Vincent Benitez is from the Philippines.But when they cast Diehz, they changed the character's heritage to Mexican.Diehz credits his acting coach for helping him land the role, and his co-stars — heavy hitters like Ralph Fiennes, John Lithgow, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini — for helping him develop his acting chops on set.From left, John Lithgow, Ralph Fiennes, Sergio Castellitto and Isabella Rossellini accept the award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for Conclave during the 31st annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on Feb. 23.(Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)Working with Fiennes, in particular, helped guide Diehz as an actor.""The beauty, the precision, the depth that he puts in his character,"" Diehz said. ""You have to jump on it, on the dynamic and the emotional dynamics and let yourself be led by him.""Fiennes helped Diehz work on English pronunciation to get the audience to hang onto every single word Benitez said.""He said, 'Be mindful of every word you deliver, it's a gift to the audience. Don't make them wonder what you said because they lose track of the message of the line.'""Conclave triumphs at SAG Awards and Timothée Chalamet wins best actor, upending Oscars predictionsOff screen, Diehz has become good friends with Lithgow.When he was suffering from stage fright the night before shooting a scene where Benitez delivers a speech that, in some ways, defines the film, Lithgow reassured him that it was normal.""He said, 'Well, you never really overcome the stage fright. First of all, it's a sign that you care about the scene. So that's a good thing. But be mindful that when you deliver your lines, nobody's going to cut you off ... you set the pace, you set the intention, you set the motions.'""Conclave has had major success — it won Best Film at the British Academy Film Awards and Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.Now, the film is one of 10 nominated for Best Picture at the 2025 Academy Awards.""It has been quite a ride from the auditions all the way to this point,"" Diehz said. ""And right now in Los Angeles, it's been amazing.

Vancouver Whitecaps name Denmark's Jesper Sorensen as new head coach,"The Vancouver Whitecaps have hired Denmark's Jesper Sorensen as its new head coach.The 51-year-old Sorensen comes to the Major League Soccer club from Brondby IF in the Danish Superliga, where he spent two seasons as head coach following 2½ as an assistant.He also spent more than a year as head coach of Denmark's under-21 national squad.Whitecaps sporting director Axel Schuster said in a release that Sorensen's teams are ""well balanced with offensive creativity and defensive organization.""Sorensen previously played more than 300 matches as a midfielder in Denmark's top league.Jesper Sorensen and Whitecaps CEO Axel Schuster at a news conference on Jan. 14, 2025. Schuster said the MLS club interviewed a number of candidates before hiring Sorensen.(Ben Nelms/CBC)The hire answers one major question for a Whitecaps side that weathered a tumultuous off-season.In mid-November, exuberant Italian Vanni Sartini was fired as head coach. A month later, news emerged that ownership was putting the club up for sale.Whitecaps sporting director Axel Schuster did not provide an update on the sale process Tuesday, saying only that it would take time.Sorensen said he isn't concerned about the pending business.Vancouver Whitecaps FC owners prepare to sell club""I'm here to coach the team, and I'm pretty confident that there's a team to coach,"" he said. ""So that's what was important for me.""Sorensen takes over a 'Caps team that finished the 2024 season with a mediocre 13-13-8 regular-season record.The campaign included the club winning a third-straight Canadian Championship title, but the team limped through the end of the MLS season and was ousted from the playoffs in the first round by Los Angeles FC.""I think we have said several times that we have been happy with most of our progress and development over the last years,"" Schuster said.""But that we felt that we lost a little bit the speed, we lost a little bit the energy at the end of last season.""The Whitecaps interviewed a number of candidates while searching for the sixth full-time head coach in club history, Schuster said. Part of what set Sorensen apart was his proven record of taking over teams and quickly having a positive impact as a coach.Sorensen said he wants his team to be known as a tactically strong group that plays close together and has more control of the ball.Sorensen, seen here while coaching Denmark's under-21 national squad, played more than 300 matches as a midfielder in the Danish Superliga.(Andrew Milligan/PA via The Associated Press)""In this league, there's a guy called [Inter Miami superstar Lionel] Messi,"" he said. ""You cannot control him when he has the ball, but you can try to affect him to play. But if you have the ball, you can control it, and then you can control better the outcome of what's going to happen.""Vancouver's goal differential last season was a middling +3 in MLS play, but the squad boasts some high-quality offence in Gauld and striker Brian White.White led the team with 15 goals last year and Gauld contributed 10 goals and 15 assists. The Scottish attacking midfielder was tied for third most helpers in the league.Whitecaps owners announced in December that they are preparing to sell the club. Schuster did not provide an update on the sale process during Tuesday's news conference.(Ben Nelms/CBC)""From what I've seen from the players in the games I watched — and I don't know them that well yet — but they have the qualities to do it. I saw a game where they scored five against Portland. Let's see if we can try to copy that,"" Sorensen said.""Football is also about entertainment ... And the best way to entertain somebody in soccer and football is scoring goals, right?""Time for Sorensen to make his mark ahead of the MLS season is fleeting.Just hours after Tuesday's introductory press conference, the Whitecaps were set to fly to Spain where they'll spend more than three weeks training.Vancouver Whitecaps fire head coach Vanni SartiniPlayers and staff will return to Vancouver in mid-February ahead of the club's first game on Feb. 20 when the team visits Costa Rican side Deportivo Saprissa to kick off a two-legged CONCACAF Champions League matchup.Vancouver will play its first MLS game of the year on Feb. 23 when it visits the Portland Timbers before hosting Deportivo Saprissa on Feb. 27.

Vancouver developer pays $8.5M for 99-year lease of school property,"The Vancouver School Board (VSB) has awarded a 99-year lease to a private developer, which is set to build a mixed-use commercial and rental building on school property after paying $8.5 million for the space.It comes a little over two monthsafter the board first movedto hand over 0.31 hectares of ""surplus"" land, just south of Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School in East Vancouver, to Vittori Developments.Vittori plans to build rental housing on the site, with space for retail on the ground floor, according to the VSB.The board says the process to dispose of the surplus landwas startedby the previous school board, after a public consultation process, and the resulting rental building will see preference given to VSB employees.But critics say the board's public consultation was rushed and limited in nature, and the move to issue the century-long lease was short-sighted.Vancouver School Board criticized over 99-year lease to developerVancouver School Board trustee Suzie Mah, who is with the COPE slate, is critical of a decision to issue a 99-year lease to a private developer — saying the $8.5 million paid by Vittori Developments is a 'drop in the bucket.'(CBC)""It's not best for the public, it's not best for children and it certainly is not best for education,"" Suzie Mah, a school board trustee from the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) slate, said.""Because when you talk about $8.5 million, that's a drop in the bucket.""Mah said the fact that the lease was issued up front, with no opportunity to review it, prevents the board from using the land in a way that would better benefit Vancouver's increasing school-aged population.She said the land, which currently houses a basketball court, was one of the few play areas in the community.A majority of Vancouver School Board trustees voted in September to dispose of land south of Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School and lease it to a private developer — a decision that has drawn flak from parents and critics.(Justine Boulin/CBC)Mah was one of the trustees who voted against the motion earlier this year, along with OneCity trustee Jennifer Reddy.However, the bylaws to dispose of the land passed after a majority of the trustees aligned with the A Better City (ABC) Vancouver slate voted in favour of them.Parents, unions raise concerns over staffing at Vancouver schoolsCBC News has reached out to Vittori for this story. In September, the developer said in a statement that a ""portion of the housing"" will be offered at below-market rental rates. The exact portion was not provided.Vittori has more than 500 rental units in the Greater Vancouver area, according to its website.Due diligence conducted: board vice-chairJoshua Zhang, VSB vice-chair and an ABC Vancouver trustee, has previously said the move was made for the benefit of the VSB's workforce, and followed a period of community engagement on the subject.The board said inan information bulletinthat VSB staff would receive ""priority access to vacant units,"" though it did not specify how exactly that would occur.""This lease agreement supports improving equity through the responsible stewardship of district resources,"" the bulletin reads.The southern portion of the Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School site — highlighted with a curved red rectangle on the left of this image — is set to be leased to a private developer, which will build a mixed-use commercial and rental building.(Vancouver School Board)Melanie Cheng, chair of the Vancouver District Parent Advisory Council, said the previous school board had already moved to lease the land in 2019 — long before the issue came up for public consultation.""Fleming Elementary School community does not want this development on their site,"" she told CBC News in September. ""They made that really clear, and the VSB board has decided to proceed with it.""Cheng said the 99-year lease has set a dangerous precedent, as the VSB is the second-largest land owner in Vancouver and could move to subdivide other schools' land for private development.LISTEN | Melanie Cheng, with the Parent Advisory Council, speaks about the lease in September:The Early Edition9:58Vancouver DPAC Chair reacts to VSB decision on Fleming Elementary leaseThe Vancouver School Board is expected to approve a lease to a developer.

Vancouver plans to increase middle-income housing with 54-storey tower on city-owned land,"The City of Vancouver announced a new plan on Thursday aimed at creating more housing in the heart of downtown,but housing advocates are critical of the plan.The plan enables the city to develop market rental housing on its own land, and in turn, generate revenue for the city through rent.""Vancouver's housing shortage, especially for middle-income earners, is holding our city back,"" Mayor Ken Sim said in a news release.The city is moving forward with a rezoning proposal for a 54-storey, 1,136-unit building in downtown Vancouver, located at Pacific Street and Hornby Street.

However, he said he's concerned that the city is planning to build and manage the tower itself because it has ""no expertise"" in this area.""Anything that can be outsourced or delegated to the private market, of course should be because that's far more efficient and they're providing better service and minimize the cost and at the same time can maximize the revenue to the city,"" he said.Instead, Pavlov thinks the city should sell the land and put that money toward other capital projects or set it aside and use the returns for regular city services.The project will be led by the Vancouver Housing Development Office, which is looking for a way to introduce more housing and bring in revenue for the city.Sim said generating income this way will reduce the need to increase taxes.Vancouver city council approves 3.9% property tax increase",2025-02-06T19:35:54.240Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-rental-housing-city-owned-land-1.7452428," The City of Vancouver announced a new plan on Thursday aimed at creating more housing in downtown Vancouver .

Vancouver suspect in 1996 cold case homicide identified through DNA analysis,"The news caught retired Ottawa police investigator Randy Wisker by surprise.It came via a courtesy call informing the former serious crimes detective sergeant about a break in an unsolved homicide he had worked on three decades earlier.The victim, 22-year-old Christopher Smith, had been fatally stabbed in an altercation on the Portage Bridge between Ottawa and Gatineau in the early morning hours of April 12, 1996.At the time, police said Smith was attacked by an unknown assailant while walking home across the bridge with his cousin after a night out.All leads in the case had dried up long ago, as far as Wisker was aware.But now, 29 years later, he was being told that modern DNA analysis used for the first time by the Ottawa Police Service had identified a suspect — 73-year-old Lawrence Diehl of Vancouver.DNA from genealogy site used to catch suspected Golden State Killer""You hear about cold cases that are solved through DNA going back a long period of time,"" said Wisker, speaking from Ottawa. ""So it was always in the back of my mind that there was the possibility that something could come up.""Diehl was taken into custody by Vancouver police on Dec. 10 and charged with second-degree murder. He was transported to Ottawa and had a first court appearance on Dec. 14.Suspect a former president of B.C. SoccerThe allegation against Diehl, a retired engineer and former president of B.C. Soccer, has not been tested in court.According to Wisker, investigators believed an unidentified person who called 911 soon after Smith was stabbed was also his killer.Police photo from 1996 shows crime scene tape around a portion of the Portage Bridge where Christopher Smith was fatally stabbed.(Ottawa Police Service)The call came from a payphone on Elgin Street in Ottawa, roughly one kilometre from the bridge. When Wisker arrived at the phone, he found blood and a dangling handset.""We knew that from the caller and the presence of blood there that it was likely the person involved,"" he said. ""Because it was a 911 call, it was recorded at the police station. We played that recording in the media in the hope that perhaps, although it was short, somebody might recognize both the voice and the circumstance.""Forensic DNA analysis leads to break in caseThe case went cold until 2020, when Ottawa police reopened it with the hope that new investigative genetic genealogy techniques might provide a lead.Suspect DNA gathered from the 1996 crime scene was sent to Texas-based Othram Inc., a company that does forensic genome sequencing. Othram works specifically with law enforcement agencies on cases of unidentified human remains and suspect identification.Washington jurors hear about final days of young B.C. couple killed in 1987""[The crime scene DNA] comes to us usually in these suspect cases in the form of a DNA extract — so just a vial of DNA they've already recovered,"" said Michael Vogen, Othram director of case management, speaking generally.""We look at hundreds of thousands of markers, sometimes upwards to a million markers of DNA. With that much data we are able to develop these profiles that can detect out to about a sixth cousin, sometimes even more distant.""Initial lab work by Othram usually costs about $1,500 US, said Vogen.In the Smith case, the suspect profile created by the company was uploaded to two public ancestry databases —  GEDmatch and FamilyTreeDNA, according toreporting from CBC Ottawa's Kristy Nease. Those two sites allow law enforcement access to the DNA profiles of users who have specifically opted in.Lawrence Diehl in an undated photo from the B.C. Soccer Hall of Fame website.(B.C. Soccer Hall of Fame website)From there, genetic genealogists with the Toronto Police Service cold case unit started the painstaking work of piecing together a giant puzzle, using the individuals identified as being related to the Smith homicide suspect to build out a family tree.""It almost works like a tip,"" said Ottawa Police Service Sgt. Chris O'Brien. ""It helps focus your investigation into potential suspects or a potential suspect, as the case may be. And then once you have that, then we switch to more traditional old-fashioned police work.""Generally, police will confirm their genetic genealogy research by obtaining a ""cast-off"" DNA sample from potential suspects to compare to the original. Cast-off DNA comes from the cells a person sheds and can be retrieved from items like a used coffee cup or cigarette butt.In B.C., cast-off DNA was usedto help identify Ibrahim Ali, the man convicted of first-degree murder in the high-profile case of a 13-year-old Burnaby girl killed in 2017, while genetic genealogy solved the cold case ofSaanich couple Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook, murdered in Washington state in 1987.Ottawa police say they know Diehl was in Ottawa in 1996 for work-related reasons and are asking  people who know more about his timeline and movements to contact them.According to his LinkedIn profile, Diehl worked as a meteorologist at Environment Canada and in various engineering and management positions.He is a longtime soccer volunteer who served as president of B.C. Soccer and director of Canada Soccer from 1998 to 2002. Diehl won the Canada Soccer Award of Merit in 2003, the same year he was named a B.C. Soccer life member, according to theB.C.

"Vancouver officer sexually assaulted colleague, but police group chat targeted victim: investigation","When a former Vancouver Police constable testified at the criminal trial of a colleague who sexually assaulted her, she says she knew it could ruin her career.The woman, who can't be named due to a publication ban, found out months after the May 2021 trial that text messages detailing her testimony were circulating among fellow officers, casting doubt on her story and whether the case could be proven.""I struggled to put into words to describe just how devastating those were,"" she said in an interview with The Canadian Press. ""They were unbelievable.""A disciplinary investigation has found a former Vancouver police sergeant shared ""disrespectful"" commentary on a fellow officer's court testimony about being sexually assaulted by a colleague.The decision against Narinder Dosanjh, obtained by The Canadian Press, includes the running commentary on the woman's testimony — apparently written by someone inside the courtroom — that calls her a ""bad drunk"" and says there was ""no way"" her case would be proved.Former New Westminster police chief Dave Jansen, the external officer who rendered the decision against Dosanjh, says his assessment accounts for a culture of treating officers who testify against each other as ""rats.""Former Vancouver constable Jagraj Roger Berar was convicted in 2021 and sentenced to a year in jail for assaulting the woman, who can't be identified because of a publication ban on her name. She said the police department never treated her as ""a victim of crime.""""I have never been treated as a victim of harassment, sexual harassment, or bullying in that workplace,"" she said. ""I have never been treated as anything except a problem that might tarnish their reputation.""Jansen says in his ruling, dated Oct. 11 that the comments in a Vancouver police group chat appear ""supportive"" of Berar and reflect ""all-too-common myths"" about women who make sexual assault allegations.'Atrocious' comments by RCMP officers alleged in internal probeWhile Jansen found Dosanjh committed discreditable conduct by sharing the chats, a complaint against a more senior Vancouver officer who was inside the courtroom and who the victim and other officers believed wrote the commentary was not substantiated.The ruling says Jansen, who retired as New Westminster's chief constable, would accept submissions before deciding how Dosanjh should be punished.The woman who was assaulted was the complainant in the disciplinary investigation and said in an interview she felt ""vindicated"" by Jansen's decision because it ""truly paints what I've been through"" after reporting a fellow officer for sexual assault.She said many other women in municipal policing fear speaking out about ill treatment at work, and some have told her about being assaulted and harassed but feared ruining their careers if they complained.""This decision is important for those women to see,"" she said. ""It shows the tides are changing. Like, this is the first win I've had.""Police watchdog orders review in case of New West officer who sexually harassed colleaguesA spokesman for the Surrey Police Service, where Dosanjh now works, did not immediately answer a question about how he was penalized and said Dosanjh declined an interview request with The Canadian Press.In his decision, Jansen said there was an ""unfortunate but often pervasive"" culture of treating officers who complain as ""rats, "" who betrayed their colleagues.""""In terms of the messages themselves, Sergeant Dosanjh alleges that they are not degrading, humiliating or derogatory and do not attack the personal character of the complainant. I disagree,"" Jansen wrote.Commentary made on Signal messaging appThe decision includes a screenshot of the commentary about the complainant, who said the order of the messages appeared to refer to her evidence while she was being cross-examined and suggested the comments were written by someone listening to her testimony.The commentary on a Vancouver police chat group on the Signal messaging app said the victim ""wore a wire twice"" and ""admitted in a cross to possibly drinking way more alcohol than she originally claimed.""""Her memory is super hazy, and there's no way you can prove beyond reasonable doubt,"" the person wrote.""And she admitted that she is really bad drunk,"" they added.Another message said it was a ""nail in the coffin"" of the case that video showed the complainant ""cuddling, holding hands"" with Berar.The decision includes a screenshot of commentary on the Signal messaging app.(Raphael Satter/The Associated Press)The victim, who became aware of the commentary when a friend in the department showed them to her, was distressed by the messages and disputed their accuracy, said Jansen.""The comments also appear to reflect some of the all-too-common myths around women making allegations of sexual assault. Some of these myths include the belief that because a victim socialized with the perpetrator, or engaged in some consensual activity with him, therefore she must have consented to the assault,"" he wrote.Jansen's decision said Dosanjh shared the messages with a fellow officer after getting them from a ""VPD chat group that he claims he knew little about, from a co-worker he claims not to be able to identify.""Vancouver police officer facing theft, breach of trust and drug chargesThe decision said other officers believed the commentary was written bya more senior officer in the department who had been present at the trial, but Jansen said the discreditable conduct complaint against that person was unsubstantiated.The decision said Dosanjh claimed he was the ""fall guy"" and ""a pawn in a broader game.""Jansen's decision said Dosanjh was a senior officer and supervisor who was aware of the ""vulnerability of victims of sexual crimes and of the myths that surround sexual assault victims.""It said Dosanjh's ""distribution of these messages that were disrespectful of an alleged victim of sexual violence who was also a co-worker, should they become public, would likely discredit the reputation of the police force.""Vancouver Police Department spokesperson Const.

B.C. log rolling world champion Jube Wickheim dies at 91,"A world-class lumberjack sportsman from B.C. has died, his family says.Jubiel Wickheim, better known as Jube, passed away on Feb. 17 at the age of 91. The Vancouver Island man was a 10-time world champion in the sport of log rolling, and an avid outdoorsman.Jube grew up in Sooke, B.C., about 26 kilometres west of Victoria. There, he went to school until about Grade 8 — not unusual for those times — and eventually began his career in forestry.Log rolling, also known as birling, is a sparring sport where two competitors, each on one end of a log floating on a body of water, try to stay on the log as it rolls. They use all kinds of techniques to try to get the other person to fall.According to a document outlining the history of logging sports in B.C., written by Jube himself, logging sports, including birling, began in small logging towns as a friendly rivalry on weekends. It soon grew into regional competitions, he said, and in the late 40s and 50s, log rollers from B.C. started travelling south to compete.Working in forestry and having an abundance of logs to roll on, it was a natural hobby for Jube. He started competing in logging sports in 1950.Jube, left, and Ardy, right, are pictured log rolling in Japan in 1965.(Submitted by Fred Wickheim)Fred Wickheim said his dad expected log rolling to be just that, a hobby, but eventually it became part of his job.""It was a full-time gig for [a] certain part of the year, like basically through April, May through to September, October. I don't think the intent was ever to be a job; it just sort of grew and next thing you know, that's what it turned into.""Jube and his brother, Ardy Wickheim, became known for their skills as log rollers. The pair started travelling the world, visiting places such as Sweden, South America and Japan. Fred said his dad even did a show for the opening of Disneyland Paris in 1992.Jube Wickheim, left, is pictured birling in 1954.(Submitted by Fred Wickheim)Jube won the world championship for log rolling 10 times between 1956 and 1969.""[Dad] told me about the first trips we did when him and his brother drove out in the old truck that they had, and driving down to the U.S., and it was a culture shock really for them [to] come from a small town — Sooke. It was interesting,"" he said.B.C. fly-tying, fishing expert Mo Bradley remembered for his helpful nature and unmatched expertiseCanada's oldest Second World War veteran dies just shy of 110th birthdayAccording to the Sept. 19, 1964, issue of the Toronto Star Weekly, Wickheim's longest roll was two hours and 40 minutes, at Oregon's Albany Timber Carnival eight years prior.Fred said it lasted so long because it was on a lake, rather than the usual pond-size body of water, which meant there were no breaks to push the log back out into the water as it approached the shoreline.When asked what made his dad stand out as a birler, Fred said ""his mental toughness.""""If you look at him from a technical point of view, he was awkward as could be all over the log, but he would wear you down till he got you where he wanted you.""Jubiel Wickheim, known as Jube, has died at 91.(Submitted by Fred Wickheim)After his time as a champion birler, Jude went on to produce and emcee logger sports exhibitions, hoping to share his love of the sport with others.Fred said his dad didn't speak much about his accomplishments; it was his passion for log rolling he keyed in on instead, talking about the history and the opportunities for travel he was given as a result of his involvement in the sport.""It was the opportunity to take [the sport] around the world and show people that would never get a chance to see something like this,"" Fred said of his dad's real passion.""We used to spend a lot of time talking to the crowds afterwards and the people that have never seen anything like it.

Rare dolphin sighting delights West Vancouver onlookers,"It was just another routine stroll for Imaan Jiwa, who often visits the West Vancouver seawall to relax after a busy workday.""It's kind of like my place of peace,"" the Vancouver resident told CBC News.But on Friday, as she rested on a bench near Ambleside Beach, something extraordinary caught her eye.""I was about to get up and leave...but then I saw this huge pod of dolphins zip past,"" she said.As the dolphins glided through the waters of Burrard Inlet, more than two dozen onlookers gathered, recalled Jiwa, mesmerized by the ""rare"" sight.Vancouver resident Imaan Jiwa captured video of a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins swimming just off the shore at Ambleside Beach in West Vancouver.(Submitted by Imaan Jiwa)""I've seen many seals and otters on the seawall ... but never dolphins,"" she said.The excitement didn't end there.After the first wave of dolphins passed by, a second group arrived — this time, more playful and energetic.""These ones were more rambunctious ... they were just like jumping all over,"" Jiwa said, noting there were about 30 dolphins in total.WATCH | B.C. man recounts the moment he was followed by a pod of dolphins along B.C.'s Howe Sound:#TheMoment a B.C. man rode the waves with dozens of dolphins10 days agoDuration1:25Jerry McArthur recounts the moment he was followed by a pod of dolphins while recording himself cruising along B.C.’s Howe Sound on his electric hydrofoil.She captured the moment on her phone, sharing the video online, which quickly gained attention. Many other videos from onlookers have also surfaced on social media.This sighting comes just days after a dolphin pod was spotted cruising through B.C.'s Howe Sound earlier in the week. A video of Jerry McArthur on his electric surfboard went viral after capturing the momenta group of dolphins joined him for the ride.Imaan Jiwa quickly pulled out her phone to film the dolphins when she saw them near Ambleside Beach. She later shared the video online, where it quickly garnered attention.(Zoom)Andrew Trites, who oversees the Marine Mammal Research Unit at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, said the pod seen in Burrard Inlet is likely part of that same group.""They may have split up into smaller groups compared to what was seen in Howe Sound,"" Trites explained.He confirmed the animals caught on camera are Pacific white-sided dolphins —an acrobatic species known for their playful behaviour.According to Trites, it's unusual to see these dolphins so close to shore because they tend to stay out in the open ocean. Their appearance in Burrard Inlet is likely related to the herring run, which likely drew the dolphins to the area in search of food.This is the time of the year that herring begin to congregate to spawn, he said.Andrew Trites, a professor at UBC's Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries, explains that it's rare to see the dolphins this close to shore, but they were likely feeding on herring that are returning to spawn.(Zoom)""It's one of the best food sources for white-sided dolphins because they're very high in fat.""Although the close proximity to shore provides an abundant food source, Trites said it also puts the dolphins at risk from predators. He pointed out the dolphins in the video could be seen ""moving very fast.""""What would they want to escape from? That would be predation from the transient killer whales,"" he said.""It's a trade-off: do you live close to the grocery store but risk getting run over, or do you live farther away and have to travel great distances for food?""Video'This is insane!' B.C. man gets en-dolphin rush as pod joins him for skim on the oceanThe animals largely disappeared from B.C.'s coast in the early 2000s,according to the Pacific Whale Watch Association, but have started reappearing over the past decade in pods of up to 200 — though elsewhere, they have been known to swim in schools of thousands.Trites said there may be more sightings in the coming weeks as the dolphins take advantage of the herring spawn season.""I would say to anybody that's out walking the shorelines, keep your eyes open, lift them up out of your phones.""For Jiwa, the encounter was a reminder of the incredible wildlife that can be found right on Vancouver's doorstep.""It's things like that that make you realize how lucky you are,"" she said.",2025-03-03T02:17:04.423Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/dolphins-vancouver-1.7472744, Vancouver resident Imaan Jiwa captured video of a pod of dolphins swimming just off the shore at Ambleside Beach in West Vancouver on Friday .

Sea otter off Vancouver Island prime suspect in river otter deaths. Researchers say that's not unusual,"A sea otter off the coast of Vancouver Island is the prime suspect in a string of river otter deaths, according to a local wildlife enthusiast and researcher.Mollie Cameron, who is both a captain with a local whale watching outfit and the president of the Wild Wise Society, which educates the public about human-wildlife interactions, says that while she's never seen the otter — dubbed Ollie — kill any river otters, she has seen it carry their lifeless bodies around for ""multiple days.""""This behaviour is not necessarily uncommon, but it has been observed consistently by the whale-watching community over the years,"" Cameron told CBC News in an email.Cameron added that all the animals she's seen Ollie carrying have shown signs of sexual trauma.""He's the only sea otter in the immediate area, so the assumption is that he does this, kills the river otters, and then sort of has his way with them for multiple days to release that sexual tension,"" Cameron told CHEK News.Otter not surf with them: Sea otter clambers onto board with surfer prompting warningSea otters are native to B.C.'s coast, but they were eradicated as a result of the fur trade. Populations were reintroduced in the early 70s, and in 2020, a federal Department of Fisheries and Oceansreportestimated that there were about 8,000 sea otters in B.C. waters.Though more otters have been observed off the north end of Vancouver Island, Cameron said, there are a handful — including Ollie — in the south.Vancouver Island University biologist and long-time sea otter researcher Jane Watson agreed that this type of behaviour Cameron is sharing is not entirely unusual.Male sea otters that are not sexually or socially mature ""don't get access to females,"" she told CBC'sOn The Islandhost Gregor Craigie.""He's what is sometimes referred to as a satellite male. He's sitting there just hoping he's made a territory that's going to have females in it, and it doesn't,"" she said.That, in turn, frustrates the otter, she said, and it attacks and tries to copulate with other animals.Ollie has been observed carrying around dead river otters, animals he is suspected to have killed, possibly out of sexual frustration, according to biologist Jane Watson.(Submitted by Mollie Cameron)Sea otters in Ollie's situation have been known to accost birds, river otters and seal pups, Watson said. Cameron said she's even aware of a sea otter attacking a dog in this way.The way sea otters mate can appear quite violent, Watson said.""The male actually grabs the female by the nose during copulation, during mating. So the females quite often end up with bloody noses and nasty-looking scars.""However, she noted that females choose males, and cautions against comparing otter mating habits to humans.""It's just the mating system that sea otters have.""To add to the situation, sea otters are big — males can be the size of a German shepherd, she said.""They're mating with animals that are much smaller than them, so it doesn't bode well for the smaller animal.""Cameron reminds people that though sea otters appear cute, they are wild animals and can be aggressive.LISTEN | Jane Watson explains Ollie's behaviour:On The Island10:46It's hard, and violent, to be a lonely male sea otter - we'll talk about the male sea otter on Race Rocks, and talk about why it's killing river ottersGregor Craigie spoke with Jane Watson, a sea otter researcher and a Professor Emeritus of Biology at Vancouver Island University.",2025-01-31T13:00:00.418Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/sea-otter-river-otter-violence-1.7444982," A sea otter off the coast of Vancouver Island is the prime suspect in a string of river otter deaths, a local wildlife enthusiast says .

"Vancouver Park Board votes to hike service fees, add amenity improvement charge in 2025","The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation unanimously passed a motion Monday that will hike the price of its programs and services by an average of six per cent in 2025, while a new three per cent amenity improvement fee will be added to select attractions and services.Board staff saidin the motionthat the increases reflected a balance of maintaining affordability, while being mindful of cost pressures and the need for long-term financial viability.The motion noted thata 2024 public engagement surveyfound more than 70 per cent of respondents were willing to pay more user fees for services.Theamenity improvement feewill be added to certain services like filming permits, the Stanley Park miniature train and admission to the VanDusen Botanical Garden.Money raised from the fee will go into a reserve fund that will be reinvested in the direct upkeep of facilities, as part of a multi-year pilot program.""Staff continue to put conscious thought into the question around who should pay, acknowledging that services that benefit all and better community at large would be funded through taxes, while areas benefited by more discrete groups be funded through user fees,"" said Steve Jackson, Vancouver's general manager for parks and recreation, on Monday.Jackson said that the board had very few levers to pull, and that increasing fees was preferable to reducing services or increasing taxes.Parking will go up by an average of six per cent in 2025, and admission to arenas and aquatic and fitness centres will increase by seven per cent.The Stanley Park Train is seeing a nine per cent hike, when the amenity improvement fee is included, which means the in-demand ride will cost $9 for adults.(Ben Nelms/CBC)The city's McCleery and Fraserview golf courses will see adult admission hiked by four per cent in the spring and summer, while admission to Langara golf course will be increased by eight per cent — and 15 per cent in the winter.While the motion was passed unanimously, park board commissioner Scott Jensen made an amendment to study whether the city could reduce the financial pressure on non-profits that use pay parking.The popular Stanley Park miniature train ride is among the park board services getting the steepest hike on average, with a ticket going up by nine per cent once the amenity improvement fee is factored in.Many members of the public attending Monday's meeting were opposed to the fee increases.They included Sherry Chen, a Vancouver mother who spoke about how the cost of living was already making it difficult for families to use park board services.""I really ask for you to look at alternative plans for the people who cannot afford any more increase,"" she said.Vancouver Park Board wants to preserve Strathcona green spaceIn supporting the motion, park board chair Brennan Bastyovanszky said the City of Vancouver doesn't allow the park board to directly keep the money generated by its services — which is what led to the amenity improvement fee.A majority of the park board and city council continue to butt heads over Mayor Ken Sim's plan todissolve the boardand transfer its responsibilities to council.Vancouver would save $70M if park board dissolved, city report suggestsVancouver mayor faces heat over park board plans — but could be burned by a 5.5% property tax hike""It is unfortunate that the cost of service [is] going up and the revenue or money that we need and have requested from the city is not being met,"" Bastyovanszky said.""So the park board is doing everything we can to ... keep our fees as low as possible.""",2024-11-26T17:18:40.986Z,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/vancouver-park-board-fees-hike-1.7393326, The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation unanimously passed a motion Monday that will hike the price of its programs and services by an average of six per cent in 2025 .

Vancouver has vastly increased early child-care spots but is still short thousands of spaces,"City staff say Vancouver now has 6,839 licensed child-care spaces for children aged 0 to five — with another 3,000 currently being built — but it's still not enough to meet provincial and federal guidelines for access to full-time child care.Child-care support groups are still commending Vancouver as a provincial leader in adding full-day child-care spaces, saying municipalities are desperately trying to make up for years of underfunding from other levels of government.""Senior levels of government have only recently come to the table with more substantial capital and operating funding,"" said Sharon Gregson, a spokesperson with the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., which is a membership-based group that advocates for an accessible, affordable child-care system.""We all know that there are still waiting lists for child care, and I hear almost daily from families who are struggling.""City of Vancouver senior social planner Mark Pickersgillupdated the city's Standing Committee on City Finance and Servicesabout the latest child-care space numbers on Tuesday.""A drastic change from where it was,"" he said about what is available now compared to six years ago.Survey of child-care spaces in Metro Vancouver shows 35% increase from 2019 to 2023In 2018, there were 4,837 child-care spots for children aged 0 to five in Vancouver, according toa presentation to councillors.

To hit that mark, Vancouver would have to bring around 4,100 spaces online for a total of 14,000 in the city.'Won the lottery'Nazma Lee, a Vancouver lawyer and member of the women's advisory committee, told councillors on Tuesday she cried tears of joy in 2012 when she learned a child-care spot was available for her family, allowing her to go back to work.""I had literally won the lottery,"" she said. ""My kids thrived in that environment, and I thrived professionally.""On Tuesday, she spoke in favour of councillors approving the adoption of provincial child-care design guidelines to overwrite the city's for all new city-owned child-care facilities.Staff said the changes were ""relatively minor,"" with the harmonization being beneficial to increasing child-care spaces more quickly.""I urge the city to continue to show leadership, to be innovative and to centre child care in planning discussions,"" said Lee.Modular child-care buildingsIn 2018, B.C. brought into force itsChild Care B.C. plan, which has, so far, brought online 23,000 new licensed child-care spaces in the province.The province has access to $3.4 billion in federal funding over the next three years and has also committed an additional $2.6 billion from 2024 to 2026, according to the city.Councillors pressed staff over initiatives to find ways to build more child-care spaces in residential areas and also underserved areas of the city, such as in South and East Vancouver.Another way the city is seeking to quickly add more child-care spaces is by finding publicly-owned sites where prefabricated or modular child-care centres could be erected.Coun. Lisa Dominato said it was essential for Vancouver to have adequate child-care spaces if it were to continue to attract families and workers to the city.""It certainly can be a deciding factor.

Vancouver School Board criticized over 99-year lease to developer,"The Vancouver School Board (VSB) is facing heavy criticism after its trustees moved to issue a 99-year lease to a private developer, which is set to build a mixed-use commercial and rental building on school property.A majority of the boardvoted on Wednesday to pass bylawsto kickstart the disposal process for 0.31 hectares of ""surplus"" land, just south of Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School, which will be leased to Vittori Developments, which has more than 500 rental units in the Greater Vancouver area, according to its website.The board says the process to dispose of the surplus landwas startedby the previous school board, after a public consultation process, and the resulting rental building will see preference given to VSB employees.But opponents of the lease say the board's public consultation was rushed and limited in nature, and the market-rate rental building will be unaffordable to many teachers and VSB employees.In addition, critics say the move to issue a 99-year lease, with an upfront lump sum payment from Vittori, is short-sighted and prevents the school board from being flexible with its land use as Vancouver grows.The lease deal is expected to close in November, with the exact price not yet disclosed.Meanwhile, Suzie Mah, a school board trustee from the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) slate, is concerned about the length of the lease.Vancouver School Board trustee Suzie Mah, who is with the COPE slate, is critical of a decision to issue a 99-year lease to a private developer — saying the $8.5 million paid by Vittori Developments is a 'drop in the bucket.'(CBC)""Ninety-nine years is two generations lost to the community, in terms of the youth educational use or public use of this property,"" Mah said.""It's a one shot, one lump sum payment, with no chance of review for 99 years. And so, you know that property [price] is going to continue to go up in Vancouver,"" she added.""And for us as school board trustees not to do that review every so often, I believe is a travesty. It's a travesty to the community and to the board.""The southern portion of the Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School site is set to be leased to a private developer for 99 years.(Google Maps)Mah was one of the trustees who voted against the bylaws earlier this week, along with OneCity trustee Jennifer Reddy.However, the bylaws passed after a majority of the trustees aligned with the ABC Vancouver slate voted in favour of them.Parents, unions raise concerns over staffing at Vancouver schoolsVancouver parents protest closure of gifted-student programMah said the price to be paid by Vittori for the lease was a ""pittance.""A spokesperson for Vittori declined an interview request from CBC News, but said in a statement that a ""portion of the housing"" will be offered at below-market rental rates. The exact portion was not provided.Due diligence conducted: board vice-chairJoshua Zhang, VSB vice-chair and an A Better City (ABC) Vancouver trustee, said the move was made for the benefit of the VSB's workforce, and followed a period of community engagement on the subject.""There is a real problem for prospective employees of the VSB, when they look at listings and then they look at the housing prices within the city,"" he said. ""I think that's the real barrier for us as an employer in terms of hiring.""When asked about whether VSB employees could affordsky-high market rentalsonce the building was completed, Zhang said there were too many variables for him to definitively comment on the issue.The southern portion of the Sir Sandford Fleming Elementary School site — highlighted with a curved red rectangle on the left of this image — is set to be leased to a private developer, which will build a mixed-use commercial and rental building.(Vancouver School Board)Melanie Cheng, chair of the Vancouver District Parent Advisory Council, said the previous school board had already moved to lease the land in 2019 — much before the issue came up for public consultation.""Fleming Elementary School community does not want this development on their site,"" she told CBC News.
